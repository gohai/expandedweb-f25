## macOS

You can install ffmpeg using Homebrew in a Terminal with

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

Alternatively, you can also [download](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/) a static binary, and place the "ffmpeg" program in the sketch directory.

## Windows

[Download](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) the binaries for Windows, and place the "ffmpeg" program in the sketch directory.
